# Pina'i — Identity, Friends & Federation Backbone

In this architecture, users can be on **different IdPs** (e.g. Alice on `idp.alice.com`, Bob on `idp.bob.com`). Each IdP's PostgreSQL stores its own local users and a *remote actor* cache. So a friend's username can be either **local** or **remote**.

---

### Data model

```sql
-- Local users registered on this IdP instance
CREATE TABLE users (
  id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  username      TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,       -- user input + NanoID suffix, e.g. "alice_xK9mP"
                                            -- used for federation: @alice_xK9mP@idp.alice.com
  display_name  TEXT NOT NULL,              -- set to user input at creation, e.g. "alice"
                                            -- freeform, no uniqueness constraint, shown in UI
  avatar_url    TEXT,                       -- presigned URL pointing to RustFS/S3
  email         TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,       -- used by OIDC
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  actor_uri     TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,       -- e.g. "https://idp.alice.com/users/alice"
  inbox_url     TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "https://idp.alice.com/users/alice/inbox"
  outbox_url    TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "https://idp.alice.com/users/alice/outbox"
  created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Cache of remote users fetched via ActivityPub / WebFinger from other IdP instances
CREATE TABLE remote_actors (
  id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  actor_uri     TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,       -- e.g. "https://idp.bob.com/users/bob"
  inbox_url     TEXT,                       -- e.g. "https://idp.bob.com/users/bob/inbox"
                                            -- cached on first WebFinger resolution to avoid repeated lookups
  instance      TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "idp.bob.com"
  display_name  TEXT,
  avatar_url    TEXT,
  fetched_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),  -- used for cache invalidation
  updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Friends relationships — owner is always local (FK), friend can be local or remote (actor_uri)
CREATE TABLE friendships (
  id                UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  owner_user_id     UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  -- always local
  friend_actor_uri  TEXT NOT NULL,   -- e.g. "https://idp.bob.com/users/bob" (local or remote)
  friend_avatar_url TEXT,            -- cached to avoid extra S3/RustFS lookup at render time
  status            TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted')),
  created_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

  UNIQUE (owner_user_id, friend_actor_uri)
);
```

> **Federated address format**
>
> The canonical address format used throughout the system is `username@domain` (e.g. `alice_xK9mP@idp.alice.com`), **without** a leading `@`. This is produced by `User::federated_address(&self, domain: &str)` on the server side. Clients receive actor URIs (`https://idp.alice.com/users/alice_xK9mP`) in some events and normalise them to `username@domain` via `actorUriToAddress()` before using them as conversation keys.

> **`username` vs `display_name`**
>
> - `username` is the unique internal identifier used for federation and ActivityPub addressing. It is composed of the user-chosen name + a NanoID 5-character suffix appended by the backend at account creation (e.g. `alice_xK9mP`). This guarantees uniqueness per instance with no coordination needed. It is never shown in the UI.
> - `display_name` is the only name shown client-side. It is automatically set by the backend at account creation to the user-chosen part, before the NanoID suffix (e.g. user types `alice` → `display_name = "alice"`). It is freeform, has no uniqueness constraint, and can be changed freely at any time.
>
> Example flow at account creation:
> - User inputs: `alice`
> - Backend sets: `username = "alice_xK9mP"`, `display_name = "alice"`, `actor_uri = "https://idp.alice.com/users/alice_xK9mP"`

### Querying the friends list

Using `actor_uri` as the universal key, a JOIN across `users` and `remote_actors` gives the full friends list, whether local or federated:

```sql
SELECT
  COALESCE(u.username,
    split_part(f.friend_actor_uri, '/', -1)) AS username,  -- derived from actor_uri for remote
  COALESCE(u.display_name, ra.display_name)  AS display_name,
  f.friend_avatar_url                        AS avatar_url,
  f.friend_actor_uri,
  COALESCE(ra.instance, 'local')             AS instance
FROM friendships f
LEFT JOIN users u          ON f.friend_actor_uri = u.actor_uri
LEFT JOIN remote_actors ra ON f.friend_actor_uri = ra.actor_uri
WHERE f.owner_user_id = $1     -- pass the caller's local user id
  AND f.status = 'accepted';
```

## 2. Real-time profile propagation when a friend updates their profile

Regardless of whether the friend is local or remote, the downstream propagation is always the same. The only difference is *how the update is triggered*.

1. A profile update occurs:
   - **Local friend**: the Msg Backbone updates the `users` table directly and publishes an event to the message broker.
   - **Remote friend**: Bob's IdP sends an ActivityPub `Update` activity to Alice's IdP via the federation queue (see section 3), which updates `remote_actors` and publishes an event to the broker.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Update",
  "actor": "https://idp.bob.com/users/bob",
  "object": {
    "type": "Person",
    "id": "https://idp.bob.com/users/bob",
    "preferredUsername": "new_bob",
    "name": "New Bob Display Name",
    "icon": { "type": "Image", "url": "https://idp.bob.com/avatars/bob.webp" }
  }
}
```

2. The IdP updates `friend_avatar_url` on all matching `friendships` rows.
3. The broker fans out a `friend_profile_updated` event to all users who have that actor as a friend.
4. The WebSocket layer consumes the event from the broker and pushes it to all connected clients:

```json
{
  "event": "friend_profile_updated",
  "actorUri": "https://idp.bob.com/users/bob",
  "displayName": "New Bob",
  "avatarUrl": "https://idp.bob.com/avatars/bob.webp"
}
```

5. Alice's client receives it and updates its local state immediately.

```
Profile update ──▶ IdP (DB + friendships cache) ──▶ Broker ──▶ WebSocket layer ──▶ Alice's client
```

---

### Summary

| Trigger | Transport | Who updates the cache? |
|---|---|---|
| Local profile update | Broker → WebSocket | `users` table + `friendships.friend_avatar_url` |
| Remote profile update | ActivityPub `Update` → Broker → WebSocket | `remote_actors` table + `friendships.friend_avatar_url` |

---

## 3. Message broker strategy

Naively pushing events directly over WebSockets creates several problems:

- Events are lost if the client is temporarily disconnected.
- No catch-up mechanism on reconnect.
- No fan-out to multiple devices (web + desktop).
- ActivityPub delivery to unreachable remote IdPs has no retry mechanism.

The solution is a **message broker** as the backbone for all durable event delivery. Given Redis is already in the stack for presence/pub-sub, **Redis Streams** is the pragmatic choice to avoid adding a new infrastructure dependency.

### Redis transport split

| Channel | Type | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Presence (online/offline/typing) | Redis pub-sub | Ephemeral — losing an event is acceptable |
| DMs, profile updates, friend requests, ActivityPub outbox | Redis Streams | Durable — must be delivered at least once |

Redis pub-sub remains appropriate for presence events since they are high-frequency and inherently transient. Redis Streams handles everything that must survive a disconnect or a temporarily unreachable instance.

### Federation outbox queue

Bob's IdP must never fire-and-forget ActivityPub `Update` activities over HTTP. Instead, activities are written to a persistent outbox queue before delivery is attempted:

```sql
CREATE TABLE federation_queue (
  id           UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  activity     JSONB NOT NULL,
  target_inbox TEXT NOT NULL,
  attempts     INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  next_attempt TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  delivered_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

A background worker processes this queue with **exponential backoff** on failure (e.g. 30s → 5min → 30min → 6h → 24h). If Alice's IdP is unreachable, the `remote_actors` cache on her instance simply stays stale until delivery eventually succeeds — which is acceptable for profile updates. As an additional safety net, a short TTL on `remote_actors.fetched_at` triggers a WebFinger re-fetch on expiry.

### Client reconnect & catch-up

The WebSocket layer becomes a thin delivery mechanism that reads from Redis Streams rather than being the source of truth. On reconnect, the client sends its last received event ID, and the server replays any undelivered stream entries:

```
Client reconnects ──▶ sends last_event_id ──▶ server replays missed entries from Redis Stream
```

This naturally handles multi-device scenarios too: each device maintains its own consumer position in the stream.

### Scaling consideration

Redis Streams is the right starting point. If federation traffic grows significantly, **NATS JetStream** is a better long-term fit — it is designed for exactly this kind of federated, multi-instance messaging topology. Migrating later is straightforward since the broker is behind an abstraction layer in the Msg Backbone.
